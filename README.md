# Fantasy-Zoo-Manager-Java-Project

This is a Fantasy Zoo which was to practise OO modelling in Java using Unit tests only. 

MVP:

•	The user must be able to add enclosures, add / remove animals, feed animals and anything else you can dream up!

Project Extensions:

•	Animals cannot be placed in the same enclosure if they would eat one and other.

•	Visitors can enter / exit the zoo if there are tickets left.

•	View the total income for the zoo.

Further Extensions:

•	Animal babies can be sold(!) to other zoos :/

•	Animals can randomly go on a rampage and break out of their enclosures
